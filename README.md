# JPaint

This is a simple paint program similar to MacPaint and MSPaint. It is written in Java using the Swing framework. For more information please visit the [JPaint Website](https://paint.yaros.ae).

**Note: JPaint is currently in beta. It is stable (as far as I can tell) but there are some features I have not yet implemented. There are still some things I need to add before I consider this finished.**
