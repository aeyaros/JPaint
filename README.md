This is a simple paint program similar to MacPaint and MSPaint. It is written in Java using the Swing framework. For more information please visit the [JPaint Website](https://paint.yaros.ae).

**Note: JPaint is currently in beta and is not feature complete. There are still some things I need to add before I consider this finished.**
